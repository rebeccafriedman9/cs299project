        <p>
       We built and tested Study Buddy, a custom chatbot designed for Wellesley first year students who may not yet have a toolkit of effective strategies for studying higher-level course material in a college environment.
        </p>

        <p>
       We performed a small user study (n=10) to see to what extent a custom chatbot could serve as an effective tool for helping Wellesley first years gain awareness of which popular study strategies are actually effective, and which aren’t, while also connecting first years with further resources that can help them right here at Wellesley.
      </p>
        <p>
Two research questions guided our work:
        <p>
<div class="citation-block">
        <p> RQ1: Can a chatbot that teaches evidence-based study strategies actually help Wellesley first-year students? </p>
       <br>
        <p> RQ2: What design choices make that kind of chatbot genuinely helpful? </p>
        </div>
<p>
While creating the Gem, we intentionally kept the chatbot’s scope very narrow. Instead of trying to act like a general academic advisor, we stuck to study habits and common study myths, a decision stemming from wanting the bot to be reliable and not overstep. By limiting its knowledge base to peer-reviewed research from psychology, cognitive science, and learning science journals we selected ourselves, we did our best to mitigate risks of hallucinations, especially regarding information and sources. 
</p>

<p>
As we entered the testing stage, we did so with a few expectations and even a few worries. First, because our sample was limited to Wellesley first year students, we anticipated that we were going to have trouble recruiting ten participants, as our participant pool was already minimized and neither of us have many personal relationships with first years such that we could ask them to complete this study as a favor to a friend. To account for this, we asked the Dean of First Year Students to spread the word about our study and called in a few favors to finally reach ten participants.
</p>

<p>
In terms of the chatbot itself, we were unsure whether our strict citations rules would perform well and presumed that the bot would potentially cite outside of the sources. We also worried that using our bot would feel too stiff or too formal, even after trying to make it engaging and friendly. In addition, although this will be discussed more in detail in the Building the Gem section, we had no idea whether anyone would actually enjoy the optional myth-debunking game, or if it would feel like an extra step that users would find inadequate. And of course, we were hoping to see at least a small shift in students’ beliefs about what actually works when studying. 
</p>

<p>
Overall, this project is especially relevant to Wellesley because the transition into rigorous college-level work can be challenging and a lot of first-years may struggle with figuring out how to learn productively. From our perspective, if a simple tool like a chatbot can help students build better habits and potentially reduce unnecessary stress, even in small ways, it’s worth exploring.

    <section id="testing" class="section">
      <div class="card-body clearfix">
        <h2>Testing and Refinement</h2>
      
        <h3> Small Scale Internal Testing within our Team </h3>
          <p>
          We started by running the first draft of Study Buddy on ourselves. This was mostly a first pass for basic prompt issues. There were times when the bot wandered outside its scope or answered things when it was supposed to adhere to the refusal prompt. In addition, it invented citations out of nowhere.
          One of the earliest problems we ran into was getting the bot to reliably refuse out of scope questions; it was quite inconsistent with it. We ended up having to rewrite the whole refusal section so the boundaries were bluntly clear. We also noticed that the game mode kept triggering even when no one actually wanted to play it, so we adjusted the rules so it only launched if the user explicitly asked for it. 
        </p>
        
        <h3> Larger Scale Internal Testing within our Class </h3>
          <p> 
              Next, we had our classmates in CS 299 try out our study.
In terms of the bot itself, based on their feedback and looking at their screenshots, two issues came up repeatedly: 

          </p>
<div class="citation-block">
          <ol>
<li> The game didn’t behave consistently and often generated only myths where the correct answer was false. 
</li>
<li>The bot mixed up citations, sometimes combining an author from one article with the title of another. Overall, it failed to cite properly.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="row my-4">
  <div class="col-md-6 text-center">
    <img src="sources.png" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" style="max-width: 40%;"/>
    <p class="mt-2 text-muted">Bot citing internet sources</p>

    <p class="mt-2 text-muted">True/False Myth Game</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  As talked about in the previous section Building the Gem, when we were building the knowledge base, we initially tried uploading 10 PDFs of some of our sources, but our topic was too broad for a limited amount of sources to cover all the myths we were testing. On top of that, the bot very frequently failed to cite properly when working from the PDF. After several rounds of troubleshooting and experimenting with different formats, we created a rule that the bot could only cite from specific cognitive and learning science journals. Once we tested that set up and saw that the bot consistently produced accurate and verifiable citations, we decided to stick with it. In addition, we told the bot that it had to admit when it couldn’t verify something in those journals and that pushed it to stop guessing. We also reworked both the myth-generation and the citation style several times. 
In terms of the actual testing materials being sent out, we received feedback regarding adding questions to our surveys to measure change in belief and changing the measurements from 1-7 to 1-10, which we implemented.  

</p>

         <h3> User Testing with Wellesley First Years </h3>
<p>
Our final round involved ten first-years. In addition to our Professors Eni and Walsh spreading awareness, we requested the Dean of First Year Students at Wellesley to send out our interest form to all first-year students. Because she agreed, we assumed that every first-year on campus was made aware of the study and urged to participate. As an incentive, we also made sure to include that the participants who complete the study fully would be entered into a raffle to win one of two $15 Amazon gift cards. 
We had over 30 users fill out our interest form, and to each, we privately sent out all of the study materials they required. These materials included an informed consent form, thorough instructions, a pre-survey, testing scenarios about the all-nighter myth and multitasking habits, a screenshot tutorial, a folder to upload screenshots, the Gem, a post survey, and a debriefing document. After sending out multiple email reminders, only 10 users fully completed the study. 
</p>
<p>
From this group, we gathered both numbers and written comments. The quantitative part included ratings of engagement, difficulty, clarity of citations, how well the bot stayed on topic, and their overall experience. We also measured how their beliefs about certain study myths changed from before or after using the bot. 
In the end, this whole process was very iterative. Every testing round exposed a different set of issues. We refined the bot and the testing materials a number of times.

      <div class="card-body clearfix">
        <h2>Results</h2>
      
<h3>Takeaways from Internal and Classroom Testing</h3>

<p>
From our own internal testing, it became obvious that the bot only behaved well when the rules were extremely explicit. Even small gaps or vague instructions led it to stretch its scope or reference sources that didn’t quite check out. When our classmates tested it, they noticed similar issues. They pointed out moments where the bot referenced outside sources and where the True/False game felt persistent and predictable. Together, these early rounds made it clear that if the bot wanted to be reliable, the prompt had to be much tighter than we initially expected.
</p>

<h4>What We Learned from First-Year Testing</h4>

<p>
Our results for first-year testing came from three main sources: the pre- and post-surveys and the screenshots. Altogether, looking at these pieces, we saw that Study Buddy does a solid job explaining study strategies and correcting misconceptions, but it is less effective at helping students actually use those strategies.
</p>

<h4>Quantitative Results</h4>

<p>
To track belief change, we asked participants to rate five statements about study habits on a 1–10 scale before and after using the chatbot.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I believe spacing out my studying over several days is more effective than cramming.</li>
  <li>Multitasking helps me study and complete assignments more efficiently.</li>
  <li>I believe taking short, structured breaks helps me focus and learn more effectively.</li>
  <li>I believe testing myself (e.g., retrieval practice) improves my long-term learning.</li>
  <li>I believe rereading my notes repeatedly is one of the best ways to learn.</li>
</ul>

<div id="chart-dumbbell" class="viz"></div>

<p>
The slope charts below show how each individual’s beliefs changed over time.
</p>

<h5>Increased Belief in Effective Study Strategies</h5>

<div id="chart-slope-q1" class="viz"></div>
<div id="chart-slope-q3" class="viz"></div>
<p>
For Question 1 in the post-survey, most participants showed an increase after using our chatbot. Two participants stayed the same because they already started with a high belief in this strategy, and one participant showed a decrease.
</p>

<p>
Question 3 showed a pretty similar pattern. Overall, the chatbot mainly strengthened participants’ beliefs in evidence-based strategies.
</p>

<h5>Decreased Belief in Ineffective Strategies</h5>

<div id="chart-slope-q2" class="viz"></div>
<div id="chart-slope-q5" class="viz"></div>
<p>
Questions 2 and 5 evaluated changes in beliefs about ineffective study strategies. For Question 2 about multitasking, four participants showed a decrease in belief after using our chatbot, which is exactly what we would hope to see. Five participants stayed constant because they already held very low belief in multitasking to begin with, and one participant showed a slight increase.
</p>

<p>
Question 5, which refers to rereading notes, showed a decrease in belief from most participants. Our bot was decently effective at debunking common ineffective study strategies.
</p>

<h5>Differing Belief Changes in Effective Study Strategies</h5>

**<div id="chart-slope-q4" class="viz"></div>**
<p>
Question 4 addressed beliefs about retrieval practice, and the post-survey results showed a mixed pattern. This makes sense to us because retrieval practice is a more complex strategy, and students come in with different levels of understanding. Depending on what they already believed, the bot’s explanation might have clarified or shifted their view in different ways.
</p>

<p>
In general, we noticed that the bot was more consistent at debunking ineffective strategies than boosting beliefs in effective ones, making its impact here more varied.
</p>

<h4>Results on Different Aspects of the Bot</h4>

<h5>Where the Bot Performed Best</h5>

<p>
A few areas consistently stood out as strengths. Students agreed that the bot cited credible sources, stayed on topic, and was easy to use. Responses for all of these items were clustered heavily around “Agree” and “Strongly Agree,” which matched what we observed during testing. The bot rarely drifted outside its intended scope, and participants appreciated that it felt focused rather than scattered.
</p>

<h5>Where the Bot Struggled</h5>

<p>
Engagement was clearly the weakest area. The “Engaging/Interactive” item was the only one with noticeable disagreement responses, and users described the interaction as repetitive or overly formal. While overall experience ratings leaned positive, many participants selected “Neutral,” suggesting that the bot felt more adequate than compelling.
</p>

<div id="chart-diverging" class="viz"></div>
<div id="chart-heatmap" class="viz"></div>
<h4>Qualitative Results</h4>

<p>
To better understand how students made sense of Study Buddy, we closely analyzed open-ended responses and screenshots and conducted multiple rounds of thematic coding. Six main themes emerged.
</p>

<h5>Efficiency</h5>
<p>
Many first-years emphasized that they value tools that save time and get straight to the point. Several users also appreciated how concise the chatbot’s responses were.
</p>

<h5>Source Validity and Trust</h5>
<p>
Students frequently mentioned that citations increased their trust in the bot. Restricting sources to specific cognitive and learning sciences journals made the information feel more trustworthy and credible.
</p>

<h5>Helpfulness for First-Years</h5>
<p>
Several students liked how Study Buddy paired them with Wellesley-specific PLTC resources.
</p>

<h5>Awareness Versus Action</h5>
<p>
One of the most important themes was the gap between knowing what works and actually doing it. Many students noted that they were already aware that certain study myths were false but still struggled to change their behavior. This highlights a key limitation of the current version of Study Buddy: it explains strategies well but does not help students follow through on them.
</p>

<h5>Is a Chatbot the Right Tool?</h5>
<p>
A smaller group raised broader concerns about using AI, including ethical and environmental considerations.
</p>

<h5>Logistical and Interaction Improvements</h5>
<p>
Finally, students offered specific logistical suggestions, such as making citations clickable and reducing how often the True/False game was prompted.
</p>

<h4>What Surprised Us</h4>

<p>
Some of these results were unexpected. We anticipated larger belief shifts overall, but many students already entered the study with fairly accurate views. In those cases, the chatbot confirmed existing knowledge rather than changing participants’ thinking.
</p>

<p>
We were also surprised by how the True/False game was received. While we designed it to increase engagement, several users felt that it interrupted the flow of conversation or became repetitive, which reduced their interest in continuing.
</p>

<p>
Finally, although our strict constraints succeeded in keeping the bot accurate and on topic, they also had the unintended effect of making the interaction feel flat and impersonal.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>

        <h3>Study Buddy's Overall Performance + comparison</h3>
        <p>Overall, Study Buddy performed quite well at its intended goal of helping first years understand which study habits are most effective, meaning they are beneficial for short and long term information retention, helping people understand content rather than just memorizing it, and positively impact not only students' grades, but their physical and mental health as well.</p>

        <p>Our participants did walk away from our study with more accurate knowledge about which study strategies would be beneficial in these regards, which aligns with our initial expectations of the Gem's performance. Yet, one aspect that was initially surprising was that Study Buddy performed better at debunking ineffective strategies rather than boosting beliefs in effective ones. To understand why the quantitative data showed this pattern, we looked into the qualitative data. When asked "What would make you trust an AI tool to give reliable study advice?", of the eight participants who responded to this question, five expressed that personal testing of the study strategies would increase their trust, and thus their belief in the information.</p>

        <div class="citation-block">
          <p>"I would try the ideas the AI tool gave me and see if they worked and therefore were trustworthy."</p>
          <p>"If I tried it and not only my academic scores improve significantly, but also if my life habits improve significantly."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Only 3 participants said their trust would be increased if the chatbot cited valid sources. So while our chatbot performed well at our intended goal of increasing awareness of which study strategies are effective among Wellesley first years, our study did not allow for participants to actually implement the strategies and report back.</p>

        <p>Knowing that our user base was looking for help implementing effective strategies rather than just to be aware of which strategies are and aren't effective, this could give us reason to extend the study and have users actually try out the strategies and report back. However, this is of course beyond the scope and time frame of this course and project, and, there is a critical step missing. While Study Buddy provides information about effective strategies, and looking longer term about how participants incorporated these strategies into their lives and the effects of such, Study Buddy as it exists now is unable to help students incorporate these strategies into their lives, though it does point to a few resources that could help. But introducing this capability, while our user base was strongly yearning for this, would allow for more non-scientific sources to be included and the chatbot to do more of its own thinking, allowing for inaccurate information to slip through the cracks.</p>

        <p>A simpler method to understand long term impacts at least in some regard would have been to ask a question at the end of the post survey such as, "In what ways has interacting with Study Buddy changed your relationship with your own study habits? Do you plan to change your study habits moving forward and incorporate any of its advice?"</p>

        <p>It would have been great to know this going in, and looking back, it would have been beneficial to do more needfinding. Our initial questions in the community survey were focused more on perceptions of AI and current belief in study myths / facts. More questions could have been focused on in what ways could chatbot focused on debunking study myths have been most helpful.</p>

        <h3>Is Study Buddy ready for wider use?</h3>
        <p>One element missing from our testing process that would have been helpful is a user needs survey. Looking back, it doesn't make sense to design for an audience without actually asking what the audience needs or wants from our design. While we did reach out to the broader community about their current perceptions of effective and ineffective study strategies and their perceptions of AI, we only learned through testing the gem that it isn't exactly what our audience wants.</p>

        <p>Additionally, it would be great if we could introduce more sources, but more testing would be needed to understand the impacts of the tradeoff of allowing it to search through more info vs time of response.</p>

        <h3>What was missing in our testing process</h3>
        <p>Because of what we have now learned through user testing, we do not think the Gem is ready for wider use. While not actively harmful, the Gem has not yet unlocked its full potential. With so many concerns around the ethics of AI and the resources it consumes, we want to make sure that if we do release this Gem as a publicly available tool for Wellesley first year students, that we do so with a tool that is not only helpful in acquiring new information, but is profoundly impactful in helping one use that information to change their life for the better.</p>
