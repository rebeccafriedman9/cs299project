        <h3>Study Buddy's Overall Performance + comparison</h3>
        <p>Overall, Study Buddy performed quite well at its intended goal of helping first years understand which study habits are most effective, meaning they are beneficial for short and long term information retention, helping people understand content rather than just memorizing it, and positively impact not only students' grades, but their physical and mental health as well.</p>

        <p>Our participants did walk away from our study with more accurate knowledge about which study strategies would be beneficial in these regards, which aligns with our initial expectations of the Gem's performance. Yet, one aspect that was initially surprising was that Study Buddy performed better at debunking ineffective strategies rather than boosting beliefs in effective ones. To understand why the quantitative data showed this pattern, we looked into the qualitative data. When asked "What would make you trust an AI tool to give reliable study advice?", of the eight participants who responded to this question, five expressed that personal testing of the study strategies would increase their trust, and thus their belief in the information.</p>

        <div class="citation-block">
          <p>"I would try the ideas the AI tool gave me and see if they worked and therefore were trustworthy."</p>
          <p>"If I tried it and not only my academic scores improve significantly, but also if my life habits improve significantly."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Only 3 participants said their trust would be increased if the chatbot cited valid sources. So while our chatbot performed well at our intended goal of increasing awareness of which study strategies are effective among Wellesley first years, our study did not allow for participants to actually implement the strategies and report back.</p>

        <p>Knowing that our user base was looking for help implementing effective strategies rather than just to be aware of which strategies are and aren't effective, this could give us reason to extend the study and have users actually try out the strategies and report back. However, this is of course beyond the scope and time frame of this course and project, and, there is a critical step missing. While Study Buddy provides information about effective strategies, and looking longer term about how participants incorporated these strategies into their lives and the effects of such, Study Buddy as it exists now is unable to help students incorporate these strategies into their lives, though it does point to a few resources that could help. But introducing this capability, while our user base was strongly yearning for this, would allow for more non-scientific sources to be included and the chatbot to do more of its own thinking, allowing for inaccurate information to slip through the cracks.</p>

        <p>A simpler method to understand long term impacts at least in some regard would have been to ask a question at the end of the post survey such as, "In what ways has interacting with Study Buddy changed your relationship with your own study habits? Do you plan to change your study habits moving forward and incorporate any of its advice?"</p>

        <p>It would have been great to know this going in, and looking back, it would have been beneficial to do more needfinding. Our initial questions in the community survey were focused more on perceptions of AI and current belief in study myths / facts. More questions could have been focused on in what ways could chatbot focused on debunking study myths have been most helpful.</p>

        <h3>Is Study Buddy ready for wider use?</h3>
        <p>One element missing from our testing process that would have been helpful is a user needs survey. Looking back, it doesn't make sense to design for an audience without actually asking what the audience needs or wants from our design. While we did reach out to the broader community about their current perceptions of effective and ineffective study strategies and their perceptions of AI, we only learned through testing the gem that it isn't exactly what our audience wants.</p>

        <p>Additionally, it would be great if we could introduce more sources, but more testing would be needed to understand the impacts of the tradeoff of allowing it to search through more info vs time of response.</p>

        <h3>What was missing in our testing process</h3>
        <p>Because of what we have now learned through user testing, we do not think the Gem is ready for wider use. While not actively harmful, the Gem has not yet unlocked its full potential. With so many concerns around the ethics of AI and the resources it consumes, we want to make sure that if we do release this Gem as a publicly available tool for Wellesley first year students, that we do so with a tool that is not only helpful in acquiring new information, but is profoundly impactful in helping one use that information to change their life for the better.</p>
